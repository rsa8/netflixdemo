## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js] which includes [Node Package Manager][npm]

### Setting Up a Project


Install the Angular CLI globally:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Download the repository.
Go to the project folder.  
cd [PROJECT NAME]

Run command.
`npm install`.

If error occur type.
`npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

Run the application:
```
ng serve

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
